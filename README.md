Small Description about my code is that I was teaching my self how to use github and al the necessary method we should be able to use.
Another thing is that I was cloning, commiting and adding files to github which was new to me.
Lastly that code was about teaching and checking my capabilities regarding github.
And now I'm working with branches and the difference between the same file but in different branches and how to make them Identical
